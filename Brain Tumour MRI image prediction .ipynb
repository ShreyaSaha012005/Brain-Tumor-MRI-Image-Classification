The project addresses a critical need in the healthcare domain by assisting radiologists in faster and more accurate diagnosis using automated image classification. With the growing availability of MRI imaging and increasing workload on medical professionals, such AI-powered tools are essential for improving diagnostic efficiency, accuracy, and patient outcomes.\n","\n","The primary goal of this project is to build and compare two models: a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** developed from scratch and a **transfer learning model** utilizing pretrained architectures like ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2. These models will classify MRI images into various brain tumor types such as glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or no tumor. Following model development, the best-performing model is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**, allowing users to upload MRI images and receive real-time classification with confidence scores.\n","\n","The workflow begins with **dataset understanding**, where the Brain Tumor MRI Multi-Class Dataset is explored for the number of categories, class imbalance, and image resolution consistency. This step also includes visualizing the distribution of MRI images to understand the dataset better.\n","\n","Next, in the **data preprocessing** phase, images are resized to a uniform dimension (typically 224x224 pixels) and normalized to a 0–1 pixel range. **Data augmentation** techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and brightness adjustment are applied to enhance model generalization and combat overfitting, especially in the case of class imbalance.\n","\n","The project then proceeds to **model building**, starting with the creation of a custom CNN architecture that includes convolutional, pooling, dropout, and batch normalization layers to stabilize and optimize the training process. This is followed by **transfer learning**, where pretrained models with ImageNet weights are fine-tuned for the specific task by replacing their final layers with custom dense layers appropriate for brain tumor classification.\n","\n","Both models are trained using validation splits and callbacks like **EarlyStopping** and **ModelCheckpoint** to save the best model and prevent overfitting. Training history is monitored and visualized to assess learning performance over epochs.\n","\n","Following training, the models are evaluated using key performance metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**. These metrics provide insight into model robustness and diagnostic reliability. A comparative analysis is conducted to determine which model offers better accuracy and efficiency in real-world application scenarios.\n","\n","The best-performing model is then integrated into a **Streamlit application** that allows users to upload brain MRI images through a web interface. The app processes the input image, makes predictions using the trained model, and displays the tumor type along with the prediction confidence. The interface is designed to be intuitive and informative for ease of use in clinical or research settings.\n","\n","Project deliverables include trained model files (`.h5`), Python scripts or notebooks for each phase, a deployable Streamlit app, and a public GitHub repository containing the entire project pipeline with proper documentation. This ensures reproducibility, transparency, and accessibility for further development or integration.\n","\n","Overall, this project demonstrates the powerful application of deep learning in **medical imaging**, particularly for **brain tumor detection**, and serves as a foundational prototype for future AI-based diagnostic systems in healthcare.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://github.com/ShreyaSaha012005/Brain-Tumor-MRI-Image-Classification"],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Brain tumors are among the most dangerous and life-threatening conditions affecting the central nervous system. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment planning and improving patient outcomes. However, manual interpretation of brain MRI images by radiologists can be time-consuming, subject to human error, and requires extensive expertise, especially when differentiating between tumor types such as glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors.\n","\n","The objective of this project is to develop an automated and intelligent system using deep learning techniques to classify brain MRI images into multiple categories based on tumor type. The system should be capable of learning complex patterns in MRI scans and making accurate predictions, even when the images vary in quality, orientation, or patient demographics.\n","\n","To achieve this, the project involves building a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model from scratch and enhancing it using transfer learning with pretrained models such as ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2. These models will be trained and validated on a publicly available brain tumor MRI dataset, with performance evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n","\n","Additionally, the project aims to deploy the best-performing model as an easy-to-use Streamlit web application, enabling real-time predictions for end users. This solution has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in making faster, more reliable diagnoses and improving triage workflows in clinical environments.\n","\n","The challenge lies in handling data preprocessing, class imbalance, model selection, and deployment while ensuring high diagnostic accuracy and a user-friendly interface.

This statistical test was chosen because we are comparing a **numerical feature (standard deviation)** between **two independent groups**: pituitary and no-tumor images. The Welch’s t-test is appropriate when we **do not assume equal variances** between the two groups, which is often the case with real-world image data. Additionally, since the hypothesis specifically aimed to determine whether the standard deviation in pituitary images is **greater than** that in no-tumor images (and not just different), a **one-tailed test** was used. The one-tailed p-value was derived by first conducting a standard two-sample t-test and then dividing the resulting p-value by two to reflect the one-sided nature of the test. If this one-tailed p-value is below the significance level (typically 0.05), it provides evidence to **reject the null hypothesis**, suggesting that pituitary tumor images do indeed have significantly higher variation in pixel intensity compared to no-tumor images.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"M99G98V6pZyI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## ***6.

Any data point lying below Q1 − 1.5×IQR or above Q3 + 1.5×IQR is considered an outlier and removed from the dataset.

Recall was prioritized because it measures the model's ability to correctly identify actual tumor cases, and in medical applications, missing a tumor (false negative) could lead to severe consequences, including delayed treatment or even loss of life. Precision was also important to reduce false positives, which can cause unnecessary anxiety, costly follow-up tests, and resource wastage. The F1-score, being the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offered a balanced perspective in cases where class imbalance existed among tumor types such as glioma, meningioma, pituitary, or no tumor. Accuracy was considered a general performance indicator but not heavily relied upon due to its limitations in imbalanced datasets.

Since SVMs are typically considered “black box” models in terms of interpretability, we applied a model explainability tool called **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to understand feature importance and decision reasoning. SHAP values explain each prediction by computing the contribution of every feature to the model's output. When applied to our PCA-transformed image data or extracted features, the SHAP summary plot revealed which components (e.g., image patterns or regions) were most influential in differentiating tumor types. This interpretability step ensured transparency in model behavior, allowing clinicians to visualize the most contributing features, thereby increasing trust in AI-driven decisions and enabling better adoption in medical diagnostics.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YnvVTiIxBL-C"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## ***8.*** ***Future Work (Optional)***"],"metadata":{"id":"EyNgTHvd2WFk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.
